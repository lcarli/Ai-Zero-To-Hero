# LLM Educational Project Instructions

This is an educational project that demonstrates Large Language Models (LLMs) using PyTorch. The project focuses on clarity, educational value, and real implementations.

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive variable names
- Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include type hints for better code documentation
- Write educational comments explaining the mathematical concepts
- Use PyTorch best practices and conventions

## Project Structure

- `src/` contains modular components of the LLM pipeline
- Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the transformer architecture
- Code should be educational and well-commented
- Include mathematical explanations in docstrings

## Educational Focus

- Prioritize clarity over optimization
- Include step-by-step explanations
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose
- Add comments explaining the "why" behind implementation choices
- Make the code accessible to learners

## PyTorch Conventions

- Use `torch.nn.Module` for neural network components
- Follow PyTorch naming conventions
- Include proper device handling (CPU/GPU)
- Use appropriate tensor operations
- Handle batch dimensions correctly

## Documentation

- Include mathematical formulas in docstrings where relevant
- Explain the purpose of each component
- Add examples of input/output shapes
- Document expected tensor dimensions
